        "Overview": "Overview\nOur MSc Advanced Architectural Design is aimed at international designers who want to enhance their design and research skills.\nThis post-professional degree helps you consolidate your own identity as a designer. You'll develop your own distinctive specialisms through research-led design, with an emphasis on sophisticated representational techniques. Our aim is to help you become a leading architect in the profession.\nThe course offers an innovative, absorbing, research-led pathway in advanced architectural design. It can be undertaken on either 1-year or 2-year pathways.\n1 Year programme\nThis pathway focuses on the dialogue and interconnection between architecture and urban regions. Each year we select an urban region in the UK, and study it through a critical, poetic and speculative lens. Recently, we?™ve been looking at Newcastle and the wider North East region, and the complicated legacy of industrialisation.\nA specialism of this programme is our emphasis on experimental, creative representational tools and modes to explore architectural issues. We encourage students to work in a range of media, from hand-drawing and modelling, to 3D modelling, virtual and augmented reality tools, and installation practices.\nOur workshop helps facilitate the programme, and each year we work to a large-scale exhibition of work on campus.\nThe pathway is structured with an intensive first semester, introducing you to a variety of representational techniques and tools, followed by a two-semester long ?˜thesis project?? in which you are able to set your own frameworks, sites and explorations for an in-depth architectural study through a range of experimental techniques.\n2 Year programme\nThis two year programme extends the first year of the programme into a deeper advanced understanding of the mutual interrelationship between architecture and urban form through integration with modules from our M.Arch programme.\nAfter completing two semesters alongside 1-year programme students, you?™ll join an M.Arch design studio in your second year, and take additional modules intended to expand your critical and theoretical thinking around architecture.\nOur School?™s leading academics in Architecture, Planning, and Landscape will support you. You'll also work with leading practitioners and creative practitioners who research techniques of drawing and designing.\nYou'll benefit from the School?™s strong culture of integrating design theory and practice. Designers must be able to deliver their speculations. This architectural design course helps you to design at the highest level, and implement your designs.\nFor achievements of the School?™s architecture and design students please read our annual Design Yearbook.\nThe city of Newcastle has a legacy of global design innovation from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. This legacy is matched by its world-renowned culture-led regeneration in the twenty-first century.\nThe city boasts both elegant historic architecture and urbanism, and contemporary design. It is a stimulating place to spend time, engaging with advanced design thinking.\nREAD MORE\nPrevious\nNext\nImportant information\nWe've highlighted important information about your course.

        "Overview": "Overview\nWithin Biomedicine PhD, MD and MPhil, we focus on exploring:\nthe mechanisms of disease\nunderstanding how disease impacts lives\nutilising new diagnostic techniques\nutilising new therapeutic techniques\ndeveloping new treatments\nAs part of the MPhil, MD and PhD Biomedicine, you'll register with a University research institute.\nYou'll have a structured programme of supervision and training. This is via our Faculty of Medical Sciences Graduate School.\nAreas of research\nWe undertake the following areas of research and offer MPhil, PhD and MD supervision in:\nApplied immunobiology (including organ and haematogenous stem cell transplantation)\nNewcastle hosts one of the most comprehensive organ transplant programmes in the world. This clinical expertise has developed with the applied immunobiology and transplantation research group. We are currently investigating aspects of:\nthe immunology of autoimmune diseases\ncancer therapy\ntransplant rejection.\nWe also have themes to understand the interplay of the inflammatory and anti-inflammatory. This is via responses by a variety of pathways. We also look at how these are manipulated for therapeutic purposes. A further research theme focuses on primary immunodeficiency diseases.\nDermatology\nThere is an emphasis on the integration of clinical investigation with basic science. Our research themes include:\ncell signalling in normal and diseased skin. This includes mechanotransduction and response to ultraviolet radiation\ndermatopharmacology including mechanisms of psoriatic plaque resolution in response to therapy\nstem cell biology and gene therapy\nregulation of apoptosis/autophagy\nnon-melanoma skin cancer/melanoma biology and therapy\nWe also research the effects of UVR on the skin including mitochondrial DNA damage as a UV biomarker.\nDiabetes\nThis area places emphasis on translational research. It links clinical- and laboratory-based science. Our key research themes include:\nmechanisms of insulin action and glucose homeostasis\ninsulin secretion and pancreatic beta-cell function\ndiabetic complications\nstem cell therapies\ngenetics and epidemiology of diabetes\nDiagnostic and therapeutic technologies\nOur focus is on applied research and aims to underpin future clinical applications. We conduct technology-oriented and demand-driven research. This relates to health priority areas such as:\nbacterial infection\nchronic liver failure\ncardiovascular and degenerative diseases\nOur research involves internal and external collaborations. We work with leading UK and European academic and industrial groups. We aim to deploy next-generation diagnostic and therapeutic systems. These are utilised in the hospital and healthcare environment.\nKidney Disease\nThere are various research programmes exploring:\nthe genetics, immunology and physiology of kidney disease\nkidney transplantation\nWe maintain close links between basic scientists and clinicians. They have translational programmes of work. These span from the laboratory to first-in-man and phase III clinical trials. Specific areas of interest include:\nhaemolytic uraemic syndrome\nrenal inflammation and fibrosis\nthe immunology of transplant rejection\ntubular disease\ncystic kidney disease\nThe liver\nWe have particular interests in:\nprimary biliary cirrhosis (epidemiology, immunobiology and genetics)\nalcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease\nfibrosis\nthe genetics of other autoimmune and viral liver diseases\nMagnetic Resonance (MR), spectroscopy and imaging in clinical research\nNovel non-invasive methodologies using magnetic resonance applied to clinical research. Our research falls into two categories:\nMR physics projects involve the development and testing of new MR techniques. They make quantitative measurements of physiological properties using a safe, repeatable MR scan.\nClinical research projects involve the application of these novel biomarkers. They aid the investigation of human health and disease.\nOur studies cover a broad range of topics including:\ndiabetes\ndementia\nneuroscience\nhepatology\ncardiovascular\nneuromuscular disease\nmetabolism\nrespiratory research\nThey have a common theme of MR technical development. They explore the application to clinical research.\nMusculoskeletal disease (including auto-immune arthritis)\nWe focus on connective tissue diseases in three, overlapping research programmes. These programmes aim to understand:\nwhat causes the destruction of joints (cell signalling, injury and repair)\nhow cells in the joints respond when losing tissue (cellular interactions)\nwhether we can alter the immune system and ?˜switch off??auto-immune disease. This includes targeted therapies and diagnostics\nThis research theme links with other local, national and international centres of excellence. It has close integration of basic and clinical researchers. It hosts the only immunotherapy centre in the UK.\nPharmacogenomics (including complex disease genetics)\nGenetic approaches to the individualisation of drug therapy are a focus, including:\nanticoagulants and anti-cancer drugs\nthe genetics of diverse non-Mendelian diseases, from diabetes to periodontal disease\nWe utilise a wide range of knowledge and experience. This is in both genetics and clinical sciences. We have access to high-throughput genotyping platforms.\nReproductive and vascular biology\nOur scientists and clinicians use:\nin situ cellular technologies\nlarge-scale gene expression profiling.\nWe study the normal and pathophysiological remodelling of vascular and uteroplacental tissues. We developed a novel approach to cellular interactions. They use a unique human tissue resource. Our research themes include:\nthe regulation of trophoblast and uNk cells\ntranscriptional and post-translational features of uterine function\ncardiac and vascular remodelling in pregnancy\nWe also have preclinical molecular biology projects in breast cancer research.\nRespiratory disease\nWe conduct a broad range of research activities into acute and chronic lung diseases. We conduct scientific studies into disease mechanisms. There is also a particular interest in translational medicine approaches to lung disease. This means studying human lung tissue and cells. We use this to explore the potential for new treatments. Our current areas of research include:\nacute lung injury - lung infections\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease\nfibrotic disease of the lung, both before and after lung transplantation\nPharmacology, Toxicology and Therapeutics\nOur research projects address the harmful effects of chemicals. This includes prescribed drugs. We look to find ways to prevent and minimise these effects. We are attempting to measure the effects of small amounts of chemicals. This is to provide ways of giving early warning of the start of harmful effects. We also study the adverse side effects of medicines. We explore how liver disease and heart disease can develop in people who take medicines. They may be taking these for completely different medical conditions. Our current interests include:\nenvironmental chemicals\norganophosphate pesticides\nwarfarin\npsychiatric drugs\nanti-cancer drugs\nREAD MORE\nImportant information\nWe've highlighted important information about your course.

        "Overview": "Overview\nOur staff and postgraduate students work in the Faculty of Medical Sciences or the School of Natural and Environmental Sciences. The Newcastle University Centre for Cancer operates right across the cancer research pathway with strengths ranging from cell biology and clinical trials to healthcare research and cancer research training, including:\nunderstanding the biological differences between normal and malignant cells\nunderstanding the molecular differences between normal and malignant cells\nusing this knowledge to develop new anti-cancer drugs\nWe're a major training base for the next generation of cancer researchers. Our Institute covers many areas of cancer research, including:\nsolid tumours and leukaemias\nchildhood and adult cancers\ndrug discovery and early phase clinical trials\nExploratory biology, target and biomarker discovery\nMolecular genetic and mechanistic studies identify critical molecular changes in cancer. It identifies the relevance to disease development and progression. We use these biomarkers and targets for therapeutic intervention. We use a wide range of techniques, including:\ncontemporary genomic\nbioinformatic\nmolecular biology\nbiochemical\ncell biology\nStudies focus on:\nhaematological malignancies (leukaemia and lymphoma)\npaediatric solid tumours (neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma),\nadult solid tumours (eg breast, ovarian, prostate, bladder and liver cancers).\nBiomarker development\nWe exploit critical molecular defects as biomarkers to enhance:\ndisease detection and diagnosis\nprediction of disease course\nsensitivity to specific drugs\ntherapeutic monitoring.\nWe play leading roles in molecular diagnostics, biomarker assessment and therapeutic monitoring. This is for national and international clinical trials.\nDrug development\nThe use of rational drug design helps achieve the exploitation of novel targets. It is through the use of structure-based design, in conjunction with medium-throughout screening. Target molecule synthesis and varied parallel synthesis approaches result in lead optimisation. Candidate drugs undergo evaluation in cell-free and whole-cell target-based assays.\nClinical trials\nClinical trials (Phase I/II/III) are undertaken in both adults and children. Trials have a strong hypothesis-testing translational research component. They are performed under:\nnational or international research networks (eg CR?“UK, Children's Cancer\nLeukaemia Group, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer)\nin collaboration with the pharmaceutical industry\nWe are one of the few academic centres in the UK able to undertake this specialist cancer research. We achieve this through:\nour expert staff\nstate of the art facilities\nclose working relationships with the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors\nclinical trials networks\nWe offer approximately 15 MD, PhD and integrated MRes/PhD studentships each year. This includes the Newcastle Cancer Centre training programme. Projects in all research areas are available to fully-funded international students.\nMembers of our postgraduate community come from a variety of subject backgrounds. This includes:\nbiological and biomedical sciences\nchemistry\ngenetics\npharmacy\nmedicine\ndentistry\nveterinary medicine\nREAD MORE\nImportant information\nWe've highlighted important information about your course.

Join us for your MPhil or PhD in Chemistry.\nResearch in Chemistry is organised into the following groups:\nMedicinal Chemistry and Chemical Biology\nOur strength in medicinal chemistry is evident through our track record of successful research. This has included the discovery of drugs that have progressed to clinic. We have core capacity in:\nanti-cancer drug discovery\nbiomolecular imaging\ncomputational chemistry\nchemical biology\nNanoscience and Materials\nOur research develops new methods to synthesise, characterise and improve our understanding of materials. We focus on materials with useful nanoscale properties.\nPhotonic Materials\nPhotonic materials refer to systems that respond to stimulation by light. These can range from single molecules to intricate architectures and molecular devices. Many systems focus on:\nconverting sunlight into chemical potential\nthe concentration of excitonic energy.\nWe focus on understanding fundamental principles by using spectroscopic examination.\nStructure and Dynamics\nStructure underpins the majority of research in chemistry, biology and materials science. The trouble is, the world is dynamic and not static. This means that understanding how structures evolve during a chemical reaction is critical. Our research relates to fundamental and applied research fields over broad time ranges.\nSynthesis, Reactivity and Catalysis\nThis research group combines the expertise of organic and inorganic chemists. Our research aims to advance fundamental knowledge and capabilities in synthesis and reactivity. We focus on the elements s, p, d and f blocks across the periodic table. Through this study we can develop new and improved materials and catalytic processes.\nImportant information\nWe've highlighted important information about your course.

        "Overview": "Overview\nBy pursuing research in the School of Engineering, you'll join a successful research group. Our focus is on energy. Our mission is to foster, promote and conduct research of international quality. We attract high-quality graduates and researchers and train them to international standards.\nThis research degree and our other energy programmes focus on topics, including:\nnovel geo-energy\npower electronics\ndrives and machines\nthe sustainable development and use of key resources\nWe can supervise MPhil and PhD projects in topics that relate to our main areas of research, which are:\nBio-energy\nOur research spans the whole supply chain:\ngrowing novel feedstocks (various biomass crops, algae etc)\nprocessing feedstocks in novel ways\nconverting feedstocks into fuels and chemical feedstocks\ndeveloping new engines to use the products\nCockle Park Farm has an innovative anaerobic digestion facility. Work at the farm will develop, integrate and exploit technologies. These will link with the generation and efficient use of renewable energy from land-based resources. This includes biomass, biofuel and agricultural residues.\nWe also develop novel technologies for gasification and pyrolysis. This large multidisciplinary project brings together expertise in:\nagronomy\nland use\nsocial science with process technologists and engineers\nIt is complemented by molecular studies on the biology of non-edible oilseeds as sources for production of biodiesel.\nNovel geo-energy\nNew ways of obtaining clean energy from the geosphere is a vital area of research. Particularly given current concerns over the limited remaining resources of fossil fuels.\nNewcastle University won a Queen's Anniversary Prize for Higher Education award. This was for its world-renowned Hydrogeochemical Engineering Research and Outreach (HERO) programme. The Sir Joseph Swan Centre for Energy Research seeks to build on its record of excellence and place the North East at the forefront of research in:\nground-source heat pump systems\nother larger-scale sources of carbon-free geothermal energy\ndeveloping more responsible modes of fossil fuel use\nOur fossil fuel research encompasses both the use of a:\nnovel microbial process (recently patented by Newcastle University). This is to convert heavy oil (and, by extension, coal) to methane\ncoupling of carbon capture and storage (CCS) to underground coal gasification (UCG) using drilled boreholes\nThis hybrid technology (UCG-CCS) is well suited to early development in the North East. It still has 75% of its total coal resources in place.\nSustainable power\nWe undertake fundamental and applied research. This is in various aspects of power generation and energy systems, including:\nthe application of alternative fuels, such as hydrogen and biofuels to engines and dual-fuel engines\ndomestic combined heat and power (CHP), and combined cooling, heating and power (trigeneration) systems. Both using waste vegetable oil and/or raw inedible oils\nbiowaste methanisation\nbiomass and biowaste combustion, gasification\nbiomass co-combustion with coal in thermal power plants\nCO2 capture and storage for thermal power systems\ntrigeneration with novel energy storage systems. This includes the storage of electrical energy, heat and cooling energy\nengine and power plant emissions monitoring and reduction technology\nnovel engine configurations such as free-piston engines and the reciprocating Joule cycle engine\nFuel cell and hydrogen technologies\nWe are recognised as world leaders in hydrogen storage research. Our work covers the entire range of fuel cell technologies, from:\nhigh-temperature hydrogen cells\nlow-temperature microbial fuel cells\nWe address some of the complex challenges which are slowing the uptake and impact of fuel cell technology.\nKey areas of research include:\nbiomineralisation\nliquid organic hydrides\nadsorption onto solid phase, nano-porous metallo-carbon complexes\nSustainable development and use of key resources\nOur research in this area has resulted in the development and commercialisation of novel gasifier technology. This is for hydrogen production and subsequent energy generation.\nWe have developed ways to produce alternative fuels. In particular, a novel biodiesel pilot plant that has attracted an Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE) AspenTech Innovative Business Practice Award.\nMajor funding has been awarded for the development of fuel cells for commercial application. This has led to both patent activity and highly-cited research. Newcastle University is a key member of the SUPERGEN Fuel Cell Consortium. Significant developments have been made in:\nfuel cell modelling\nmembrane technology\nanode development\ncatalyst and fuel cell performance improvements\nImportant information\nWe've highlighted important information about your course.

These skills will enhance your future employability and career progression. We focus on supporting you in becoming a scientist-practitioner in forensic settings. You'll gain an in-depth knowledge of:\noffending and victim pathways\npsychological assessments\nrehabilitation\ninvestigative and court processes\ntopical issues within forensic psychology\nYou'll conduct risk assessments and case formulations during practical sessions. You'll conduct structured framework research relating to forensic psychology practice. The course has two different routes:\nForensic Psychology, MSc (Accredited)\nForensic Psychology, MSc (Non-accredited)\nWe offer both accredited and non-accredited courses:\nForensic Psychology, MSc (Accredited)\nThis route is accredited by the British Psychological Society (BPS), thereby accounting for Stage 1 of the Qualification in Forensic Psychology. You must have a first degree in psychology providing Graduate Basis for Chartership (GBC) with the BPS to apply to this course.\nForensic Psychology, MSc (Non-accredited)\nThis route is not accredited by the BPS. It does not fulfill Stage 1 of the BPS qualification in forensic psychology. If you want to progress onto Stage 2 of the Qualification in Forensic Psychology in the future, you need to go back and complete the necessary conversion programme. This is to give you the requisite GBC with the BPS.\nThis route is for those students who do not have a first degree in psychology providing GBC with the BPS. Their degree must cover research methods and statistics relevant to psychology. For example, a joint or combined degree that includes psychology or an international psychology degree that does not confer GBC with the BPS).\nOther qualifications/experience may be acceptable. This will be considered by the Programme Director. Applicants may include:\nmental health specialists\npolice officers\nprison officers\nsocial workers\nsupport workers\nREAD MORE\nImportant information\nWe've highlighted important information about your course.

You'll train to become a practitioner who helps those experiencing depression and anxiety. You'll do this through the use of evidence-based psychological therapies.\nThe Low Intensity Psychological Therapies programme trains Psychological Wellbeing Practitioners under the NHS England talking therapies initiative. Low intensity therapy constitutes part of the national institute of clinical excellence (NICE) guidelines for the evidenced based treatment of mild to moderate common mental health problems.\nThe emphasis of low intensity therapy is to help patients self-manage their symptoms of depression and anxiety, using primarily cognitive and behavioural interventions. The programme will equip Psychological Wellbeing Practitioner trainees with the clinical competence to provide low intensity cognitive behaviour therapy, usually within a public or third sector healthcare setting. Typically, when qualified, Psychological Wellbeing Practitioners work in an NHS or public sector clinical setting, on band 5 and 6 (NHS or equivalent) salaries.\nThe programme directors are Laura Stevenson and Dr Claire Lomax.\nThe team lead is Karen Wilson.\nEnquires to: Iapt.director@ncl.ac.uk\nREAD MORE\nImportant information\nWe've highlighted important information about your course.

        "Overview": "Overview\nWe accept applications for MPhil, MD and PhD in Neuroscience in many research areas. These include:\nMotor systems development, plasticity and function\nWe conduct studies of normal and abnormal development. We also explore the plasticity of the motor system. This involves both clinical and preclinical developments. We run functional studies and computer modelling of motor system activity. We explore this throughout the neuraxis. We research the development and assessment of novel therapies for motor disorders/lesions. This includes stem cell and brain-machine interface.\nVisual system development, plasticity and repair\nWe research novel neuro-technological approaches to retinal dystrophy repair. This includes brain-machine interface and stem cells. We use in vitro approaches to look at retinal development and visual system wiring.\nNeural computation and network systems\nWe conduct experimental and theoretical studies. This is to understand how neurones throughout the brain interact. We explore how they act in localised networks to compute complex tasks.\nBehaviour and evolution\nOur research groups take evolutionary and comparative approaches to study brain behaviour. We compare brain function and behaviour. We explore this in:\ninsects\nbirds\nmammals\nWe study the ecological and evolutionary functions of their behaviour. Much of our work is at the forefront of:\nneuroethology\nbehavioural ecology\ncomparative cognition\nIt has important implications for the study and practice of animal welfare.\nVisual perception and human cognition\nWe research:\ncolour and depth perception - perception of natural scenes\npsychophysics and attention - memory\nword learning in children\nbody image dysfunction\nvisual social cognition and face processing\nadvertising and consumer behaviour.\nAuditory neuroscience\nWe conduct clinical and preclinical studies. We explore the brain mechanisms involved in the detection, discrimination and perception of sound. We look into how these mechanisms affect individuals with brain disorders. Disorders include dementia, autism and stroke.\nPain\nOur research focuses on:\nunderstanding mechanisms underlying pain, analgesia, and anaesthesia\nthe development of methods to assess pain and to reduce pain in animals and humans\nPsychobiology\nWe conduct studies in laboratory animals, healthy volunteers and patient populations. We investigate the mechanisms underlying mood, anxiety and addiction disorders and their treatment. Allied research looks at normal neuropsychology. It explores psychiatric disorders the physiology and pharmacology. Research focuses on neurotransmitter and endocrine systems implicated in psychiatric disorders.\nNeurotoxicology\nWe explore mechanisms of action of established and putative neurotoxins. This includes environmental and endogenous chemicals and naturally occurring toxins.\nForensic psychiatry and clinical psychology\nOur research covers:\nthe assessment, treatment and management of sex offender risk\ndevelopment and assessment of cognitive models\ncognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) treatment for bipolar disorder, psychosis, anxiety and developmental disorders\ndevelopmental disorders of perception and cognition\nSystems and computational neuroscience\nWe conduct theoretical and experimental studies. We aim to understand the following areas of memory:\nneuroanatomy\nneuropharmacology of vision\nvisual attention\nepisodic\nBehaviour and evolution\nOur research groups take evolutionary and comparative approaches to study brain behaviour.

        "Overview": "Overview\nThe School of Pharmacy's focus is on multidisciplinary translational research. We produce work that is relevant to real life. We have scientists and clinicians working together on all aspects of pharmacy, from the bench to the bedside. Our research spans the fundamental understanding and concepts of:\npharmacology\npharmaceutical chemistry\ndrug delivery and formulation science\nclinical pharmacy\nWe offer MPhil and PhD supervision in the following research areas:\nDisease-Selective Medicines\nThe topic examines the discovery and development of new small molecule therapeutics. This considers improved disease selectivity and reduced systemic toxicities, through the use of:\nrational drug design and synthesis\nlead optimisation\npreclinical evaluation in cellular disease model systems.\nWe explore developments of cancer prodrugs with tumour-specific activation and reduced systemic toxicity. We explore novel therapies for improved treatment of infective diseases including:\ndengue\nother haemorrhagic fever viruses\ntuberculosis\nImproved Strategies for the Treatment of Chronic Pain\nWe explore the molecular mechanisms that generate the symptoms of chronic pain. We look at its translation to strategies for pain control, including opioid treatment.\nCellular Physiology\nInvestigating hormones to control epithelial ion channel activity and physiological action. We look at the control of sodium channel activity in the distal nephron and consequent hypo and hyper-tension.\nSafety Pharmacology and Discovery Toxicology\nDevelopment of new preclinical tools for identification of therapeutics with potential safety liabilities. We look at relevant cell models and systems for the detection of effects on the heart.\nPharmaceutics and Chemical Principles of Dosage Form Design\nPharmaceutical formulations to deliver active molecules to treat disease. We have active research on:\nintermolecular interactions\nnanoscale pharmaceutics and nanotherapeutics, including dosage form design from intermolecular interactions,\ndelivery of biopharmaceuticals.\nIn particular research focuses on:\ndetermining strategies for improving drug solubility\naltering materials properties to enable drug delivery and the production of enhanced medicines\nsupramolecular Pharmaceutics. In particular, inter/intramolecular interactions and kinetics\nfundamental and translational nanomedicines\nunderstanding and improving drug delivery via the subcutaneous, inhaled and intravitreal routes\nPharmaceutical Public Health\nThe role of community pharmacies as a central fulcrum to address health inequalities and behaviour change in relation to:\nsmoking\nalcohol\nsubstance misuse\nsexual health\nobesogenic behaviours\nCommunity pharmacies are the point of contact for patients in the wider primary healthcare team. We test the interactions of this relationship and potential role for pharmacies in the diagnosis of disease. We also explore improvements in public health from this relationship.\nRational Medicines Use\nThe safe and efficient use of medicines in primary and secondary care is central to the role of every pharmacist. Medicines are becoming complex and patients are being given more preventative medicine focused at improving their health. This can pose clear risks and significant potential for complications. Rationalisation of medicine usage:\ncrosses care boundaries\napplies both within primary and secondary care\nWe investigate prescribing habits and the mechanisms to support patients who take complex medicines for long periods.\nPatient Safety and Health Information Technology\nMedication errors can result in patient injury or death, and are preventable. These errors can occur at the stages of ordering, transcription, dispensing and administration. We conduct studies around key technological advances targeted towards intercepting these errors and improving patient safety. Our research focuses on evaluation of specific health information technology prevention strategies throughout the medication use process. We have a particular emphasis on health information technology. This includes its broader implications for medical care and policy. We also explore the different types and causes of errors that occur during the prescribing process when using electronic systems. We provide national and international recommendations for their improvement.\nSee our staff research profiles\nSee a non-exhaustive list of available PhD projects\nImportant information\nWe've highlighted important information about your course.

The foundation is a common core of modules dealing with essential theoretical issues and research methods. You are also offered specialised modules which act as the basis for your thesis.\nYou'll have an individual course of study based on your needs and the sponsor's requirements.\nOne of the strengths of the course is that it brings together the teaching and research expertise of staff belonging to the Phonetics and Phonology Research Group. This group is composed of students and staff working in phonetics and phonology across three of our academic schools:\nSchool of Education, Communication, and Language Sciences (ECLS)\nSchool of English Literature, Language and Linguistics (SELLL)\nSchool of Modern Languages (SML)\nThis widens the pool of modules that are available. It enables you to interact with staff and students from a wide variety of backgrounds and expertise. Our particular areas of strength are in:\nphonetics and phonology in first/second language acquisition and bilingualism\nsociophonetic perspectives on speech perception and production\nrole of voice quality in speech processing\nlaboratory phonology and links between phonetics and phonology\nphonetic and phonological characteristics of languages and language description in segmental and suprasegmental aspects\nprosody and timing in the world's languages\nneurocognition of speech and language processing with focus on phonetics, phonology, and prosody\nThe cross-cutting theme within these areas that we are all interested in is the link between:\nperception\nproduction\nlearning\nOur perception research looks at the role of speakers and listeners in shaping linguistic systems and sound change.\nWork on production and learning covers our interest in investigating meaningful sound patterning. This includes:\nhow it's acquired\nstored\nproduced within a social context\nOur work also investigates categorical and graded aspects of speech and the role of language-specific factors in shaping these categories.\nREAD MORE\nImportant information\nWe've highlighted important information about your course.

        "Overview": "Overview\nOur broad range of research means you can specialise in topics including:\npolitical philosophy\ncomparative institutions or behaviour\nBritish politics\ninternational relations\nrace and ethnicity\ngender\nYou'll receive training on how to become an independent researcher. You'll be supported by a supervisory team of at least two members of our research staff who will guide you through the research process. Your supervisors will also play a key role in helping you develop a thesis project that will open job opportunities in academia or outside of academia depending on your goals.\nMeet our Politics research students and read more about their research\nYou will be able to take part in the Researcher Education and Development. This is an advanced and interdisciplinary research training and researcher development programme created by the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences.\nYou'll also have the opportunity to enrol in the Postgraduate Certificate in Research Training. This provides a broader knowledge of different research methodologies. It equips you with the skills to carry out advanced research in your area of interest.\nThe politics of difference\nExamine the issues thrown up by the social and political differences of humanity from a variety of perspectives including:\nanalytical and continental political philosophy\ncomparative politics\ninternational politics\npost-colonialism\nPolitical Behaviour\nExamine the different forms of political participation that link society to the political systems of the world. We look at both the formal electoral process and non-electoral politics (social movements, protest groups, etc) Our research on the emergence of virtual political participation means that some of our work intersects with popular culture and political communication.\nPolitical ideologies and political thought\nFocus on the history of political thought as well as how these ideas are part of programmes for political action. Our research incorporates both historical and contemporary political thought prominent in the Western tradition as well as Asian philosophy and post-colonial thinking. This is an interdisciplinary theme, serving as a bridge between empirical political science and political theory.\nGlobal economic, environmental challenges and political economy of development\nStudy the importance of political ideas such as sustainable development and globalisation, as well as the struggle to define the core problems that society faces.\nThese challenges pose questions to the nature and reform of global governance, while generating tensions between the state and transnational forces in global politics and political economy.\nWe also focus the interaction of economic forces and principles with political power in the development of societal economics and welfare, as well as on theories of development and post-development. We cover a range of geographic areas in Africa, the Americas, Europe and Asia.\nDemocracy, the modern state and political organisations\nExamine?the role of interest groups, social movements, political parties, third-sector actors and charities, community organisations and postcolonial nationalism in relation to the modern state. We draw from ancient and modern political thought to understand the interpretation of democracy (including democratic rights and the foundations of democracy).\nPolitical economy of development\nFocus?on the interaction of economic forces and principles with political power in the development of societal economics and welfare, as well as on theories of development and post-development. We cover a range of geographic areas in Africa, the Americas, Europe and Asia.\nCritical geopolitics, security and migration\nFocus?on thinking critically about the political dynamics, consequences and discourses of historical and contemporary geopolitics. We cover both historical and contemporary questions of security?which also arise in relation to the migration-security nexus and other intersections.\nTheory of international relations\nTake an active role in the global debate on the units, actors and structures that shape the dynamics of international politics. Our research covers the political consequences of the constitution of the international as a distinct kind of relation.\nGovernance in Britain and wider Europe\nInvestigate?the dynamics driving public policy-making at national, EU and international levels. We focus on the challenges multi-level governance offers for concerns about legitimacy and accountability. This includes the changing relationship between the governing and the governed over matters of politics and policy. Our geographic scope includes the United Kingdom, Western Europe, Eastern Europe and Russia, and the Mediterranean\nGlobal justice and human rights\nReflect on?the increasing need to tackle issues at a global rather than a state-only level. We tackle questions of justice from an issue perspective as well as surveys of nationalism, states, and various non-cosmopolitan theories of global justice.\nWe're committed to theoretical and methodological pluralism. We also support PhD students who want to pursue an interdisciplinary research agenda.\nOur academic researchers are published in top-ranked academic journals and work in close collaboration with over 3,000 non-academic partners locally and around the world.\nOur programme is international, with students coming from 27 countries in the last six years.\nWe welcome research projects devoted to politics subjects, as well as interdisciplinary work that attracts engagement from other departments and universities.\nREAD MORE\nImportant information\nWe've highlighted important information about your course.

        "Overview": "Overview\nUrban Planning is the understanding of the place-making processes that underpin places, society and the environment. It's also interdisciplinary, with professionals having an understanding of a range of topics. You'll gain an understanding of the fundamentals required for a successful career in planning or the wider built environment professions.\nThe Urban Planning master's is fully accredited by the Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI). The Development pathway is accredited by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) and offers a RICS-accredited route to gain Chartered Surveyors status.\nThe course is suitable if:\nyou are new to studying planning\nyou have studied planning before but in a different regulatory context\nLeading planning academics teach our modules. They are members of planning teaching staff in the School of Architecture, Planning and Landscape. Their world-leading research informs the teaching programme.\nWe teach the course on our Newcastle campus. You can study full-time over 12 months or part-time over two years.\nPart-time study consists of the same modules and options as the full-time programme.\nThis Master's in Urban Planning has five specialist pathways. Choose a pathway to suit your individual needs, background and career aspirations.\nThis is a social theory degree with no design content. If you're interested in a design degree, please see our Urban Design MA, PGDip.\nDevelopment pathway\nThe planning of the built environment is becoming more driven by economic rationales. This pathway will equip you with the knowledge and skills to critically engage with these. You'll be introduced to a variety of practical and theoretical skills. These provide a solid basis to build your career as a planner or surveyor.\nCareer pathways may include working for both public and private sectors or non-governmental organisations, such as:\nthe Homes and Communities Agency\nsocial enterprises interested in development\nhousebuilders and developers\nGlobal Development pathway\nThis specialism is ideal if you want to work in spatial planning within an urbanising and globalising world. The pathway bridges the gap between urban planning and international development. You'll engage in the theoretical and practical context of planning in a range of countries.\nThe pathway will prepare you for work as an urban planner and development professional around the world. If you are an international student, you can relate the core learning to your own country.\nRegeneration pathway\nThis pathway develops your knowledge of approaches to regeneration in Europe and North America. It covers different policy approaches, their potential and their actual impact on place, society and the environment.\nYou'll learn:\ntheories of regeneration practice\nalternative regeneration policy approaches (regional, urban and rural)\nthe historical origins and changing political and cultural contexts that have shaped urban policy\nthe potential and limitations of urban policy\nTeaching focuses on designing and delivering regeneration projects as well as developing a critical understanding of context.\nConservation pathway\nThis is for you if you?™re interested in historic cities and urban conservation. It will develop your skills in conservation analysis, strategy-making and implementation. This pathway looks at conservation in the UK and internationally.\nIf you?™re from a country with strong conservation traditions, or perhaps observing the loss of your heritage, you can explore:\nwhat heritage is\nwhat is valued and why\nwhat can be done to intervene on heritage's behalf\nYou'll explore ?˜the historic??city within different national contexts. You'll develop your understanding of the planning principles of conservation and heritage management.\nThe specialism is taught by a mixture of academic staff and conservation practitioners. It draws on the School?™s conservation expertise and connections to engage you in the theoretical and practical context of heritage conservation.\nGreen Infrastructure and Landscape Planning pathway\nGreen Infrastructure (GI) is the development of solutions to address the increasing human impact on the environment. In an urbanising world, natural systems are under increasing pressure. GI development and landscape planning are important tools to respond to these pressures. These tools can enhance, restore or create landscapes with spaces and linkages for both human and natural systems.\nThis specialism offers a mix of teaching styles to develop a creative strategic approach to GI and landscape planning. Through real-world examples and the guidance of professionals, you'll gain an understanding of:\nthe legal framework of GI\nengagement with local communities\nyour own interests within the specialism\nImportant information\nWe've highlighted important information about your course.
